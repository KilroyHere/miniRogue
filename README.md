# miniRogue
My own implementation of a Rougelike game.
Playable at: https://repl.it/@kilroyHere/Project3#readme.md
Made for a Project in my Data Structures and Intro to CS II class at UCLA.
Made using C++ in VS Code.

.Move one space using the arrow keys or the classic  Rogue movement letters:
(USE ARROW COMMANDS)

h to move left

l to move right

k to move up

j to move down

.Attack a monster next to you by moving in its direction. (B,D,G,S)

.Pick up an object by standing on it and typing g. ('?' - Scrolls ) ( ')' - Weapons)

.Wield a weapon by typing w and then selecting a weapon from your inventory.

.Read a scroll by typing r and then selecting a scroll from your inventory.

.See an inventory of your items by typing i.

.When standing on a stairway, descend deeper into the dungeon by typing >.

.Quit the game by typing q.

.Cheat by typing c. 
This command sets the player's characteristics to make defeating monsters easy.
