# miniRogue
My own implementation of a Rougelike game.
Playable at: https://repl.it/@kilroyHere/Project3#readme.md
Made for a Project in my Data Structures and Intro to CS II class at UCLA.
Made using C++ in VS Code.

.Move one space using the arrow keys or the classic  Rogue movement letters:
(USE ARROW COMMANDS)
h to move left
l to move right
k to move up
j to move down

.Attack a monster next to you by moving in its direction. (B,D,G,S)
.Pick up an object by standing on it and typing g. ('?' - Scrolls ) ( ')' - Weapons)
.Wield a weapon by typing w and then selecting a weapon from your inventory.
.Read a scroll by typing r and then selecting a scroll from your inventory.
.See an inventory of your items by typing i.
.When standing on a stairway, descend deeper into the dungeon by typing >.
.Quit the game by typing q.
.Cheat by typing c. This command sets the player's characteristics to make defeating        monsters easy, and exists solely to let us test some aspects of your program without      our having to slog through a regular game.
